How to use the code
-----------

The Python code uses the Panda3d game engine to run. See the "getting Panda3d" file for brief instructions on where to download it and how to get it to work with Python.

The code itself is nothing more than loading a 3d model (the .egg file) and having it shift through colors within the program.
